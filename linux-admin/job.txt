Linux System Administration Crash Course


Linux Boot Process

ฺBIOS = Basic Input Output System
       - firmware use in booting process which first software that is run   
         when computer power on 
       - bios run independent just to test hardware component  
       - load boot loader (linux) / operating system (window)
       

Boot Loader = there are 2 version of loader so far  
    - LILO linux Loader  (old version)
    - GRUB Grand unified boot loader (new version)
        booter loader is to start operating system with initrd

initrd => initial ram disk 
    initrd is temporary file to be loaded to ram when system boot
    this temporary file is to detect hardware ,run modules to get system file 
    mounted on /boot  such as  vmlinuz/vmlinux
  
vmlinuz/vmlinux => compressed kernal in vm format 
    when boot machin message that show on screen is run by kernal
    $dmesg or /var/log/dmesg mean to see message in ring buffer including those of kernal 

telinit (init) for runlevel
    = is to tell linux which runlevel and target to be used 
    linux have many level to run which ic control by init program
    run level 0  mean power off system 
    run level 1  mean single user mode
    run level 2-5 mean normal system operation 
    run level 6 mean reboot system 

SystemD by target 
    systemctl (systemd) is now use instead of telinit 
    command that can be use instead of runlevel 
    shutdown
    reboot
    poweroff

System Logging
    Syslog standard for all application to use and save their log message in central location
    How to categorize log message 
    Facilities (where message come from )
    Serverities (type of message)
        emergency, alert, critical, error, warning, notice, info 
    syslog servers such as syslogd, rsyslog, syslog-ng
        syslog server will manage message base on facility / serverities such as keep in /var/log or send via network
    LOG command
    $logger is to keep all log message in your application
    $logrotate is to keep log message until it is replace by new one as rotation concept to save disk space

Disk Management Partition
    Type of Parition table
        MBR - Master Boot Record (old technology)
        GPT - GUID Partition table (support 128 partition, 9.4 seta byte )
    Mount Point = "/" or root directory 
        such as partition B = /B  similart to drive:B in window 
    Command to modify partition 
    $fdisk
    $gdisk
    $parted

    Every partition must has file system
    $mkfs 
        $mkfs -t mean type of Device    
        $mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb3
    $mount
        $mount 
        $mount /dev/sdb3 /opt    
    $df to see space use
    $unmount
        $unmount/opt
        $unmount/dev/sdb3
    
Disk Management - File System table
    /etc/fstab
    view UUIDs (universl unique identifier) and labels
        $lsblk -f    to see all device attach to system
        $blkid       to see all uuid of device attach to system
    create tools
        $e2label     to set label (name) of device


Manageing User and Groups
    Account infor store in 
    /etc/passwd 
    /etc/shadow (read by suuper user only)
    
    Account have attributes as 
        username, UID, GID (default group), comment, home directory, shell

    $useradd
    $userdel
    $usermod

    /etc/group
    $groupadd
    $groupdel
    $groupmod
    $groups
    $group json

Switch user and shutdown
    $su mean to switch user
    $whoami
    $sudo 
    $sudo -s or $sudo su
    $visudo  mean to edit sudoers file

TCP/IP Networking
    IP address => xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
    Subnet mask
    Broadcast address

    class network
    class    network             Ex                                host allowed
    A    1.x.x.x->127.x.x.x      127.0.0.0-127.255.255.255         16,777,216
    B  128.0.x.x->191.255.x.x    128.0.0.0-128.0.255.255           65,536 
    C  192.0.0.x->233.255.255.x  192.0.0.0-192.0.0.255             255 

    subnet mask  use to split ip address 
        First  - network id 
        Second - host address
    subnet mask
        Class A : 255.0.0.0
        Class B : 255.255.0.0
        Class C: 255.255.255.0

        CIDR- Classless Interdomain Routing
        Private Address space (not for public internet)
        10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255       for class A
        172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255     for class B
        192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 for class C 

    To see ip address
    $ifconfig
    To show host name
    $hostname
    $hostname -f 
    $uname -n

Linux Networking
    DNS and name resolution    id address <-> hostname
        $host [name]
        $dig
    /etc/host      have list of hostname+ip address (it can store private host for internal communication)
    /etc/nsswitch.conf   to config how system check hostname

Network port
    to indentify service on each host
    well-known/privieged/system port (1->1023) only super user can use these port
    unprivilege (1024-65535)

    DHCP  => dynamic host configure for assign internal host address to device 
    Static IP address
    Ubuntu /etc/network/interfaces

    $ip or $ifconfig to manually config network
    $ifup or $ifdown 

๋Jobs and Processes
    ps , ctrl-c, ctrl-z , bg,  fg,  jobs, kill 

Schedule jobs with cron
    cron service run schedules jobs
    $crontab    to schedule job such as rotate log file or other routine job

Managing software
    Package
    Package Manager
    RPM yum , rpm 
    DEB apt, dpkg

Disk management and file system creation
Manage user and group
